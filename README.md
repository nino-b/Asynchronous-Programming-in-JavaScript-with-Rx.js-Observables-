# Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript (with Rx.js Observables)

# Introduction

Welcome! This repository shows my journey through [Jafar Husain's](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/jafar-husain/) [Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript (with Rx.js Observables)"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/asynchronous-javascript/) workshop. This workshop contains course resources, with the code I write along and my notes. The code in this repository is based on ["Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript (with Rx.js Observables)"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/asynchronous-javascript/) workshop.

## About the Workshop

This workshop covers the fundamentals of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. How to effectively use async APIs to keep applications responsive and performant. Gain deep understanding of the tools, concepts, and libraries to master asynchronous programming, how to avoid common mistakes and write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
